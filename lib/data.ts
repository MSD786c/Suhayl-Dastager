export const aboutMe = `Analytical AI graduate acting as the bridge between business strategy and technical delivery. I scope ambiguous data problems, design measurable experiments, then ship the automation, models, and dashboards that let leaders act with confidence. Whether it is advising on AI onboarding flows, architecting analytics stacks, or coaching teams on KPI storytelling, I bring a consultant's mindset with an engineer's toolkit (Python, SQL, React/Next.js, Flask, Supabase, Power BI, GPT-4, Gemini) to move from whiteboard to adoption fast. Focus areas: data science, data analysis, AI consulting, strategy consulting, data automation, and data engineering.`;
